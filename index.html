        <p>
            Chess is one of my Hobbies and i really like playing it. I am a sort of Good player but not that good. I started playing it when I was only 6 to 7 Years old and today I am 12 years old. Now I even know how to do a check and mate in less the 5 turns. I started learning it from my freinds and family, although I even have other hobbies such as imagining writing and reading stories, Making freinds and watching movies but Chess is my favourite one.
